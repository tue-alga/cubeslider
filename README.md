SquareSlider is a framework for modular robot reconfiguration in the sliding square model. It lets you build a configuration and then apply reconfiguration algorithms to it.

## Building

SquareSlider uses webpack to bundle the JavaScript code and its dependencies into a bundle.

First install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Build the tool (output appears in the `dist` folder):

```sh
npm run build
```

Run a development server that automatically rebuilds the bundle (and reloads the page in the browser) on code changes:

```sh
npm run start
```
